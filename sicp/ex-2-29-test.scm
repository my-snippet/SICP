(test-begin "balanced mobile")

;; Test scenario
;;
;; Given
;; - Branch b0, b1 has same torque, but different length, weight.
;; ( torque = length * weight )
;; - Branch b2 has m01 as a submobile.m0- Mobile m02 has b0, b2 as branches.
;; - Mobile m02 has b0, b2 in order as branches.
;; - Mobile m20 has b2, b0 in order as branches, that is, 
;; m02 and m20 are like a mirror relationship.
;; m02+m20 has branch that consists of m02 and m20 with same length,
;; that is, balanced mobile
