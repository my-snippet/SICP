;; Naming problems.
;; If a procedure evaluates whether does the structure of a branch
;; contain structure or not, then what is a suitable name for the
;; procedure?
;; 1. explicitly
;; 2. reducing
;; Example
;; -> does-the-structure-of-a-branch-contain-structure-or-not?
;; -> does-structure-contain-structure?
;; -> contain-structure?

;; Cross reference problems.
;; 1. balanced & branch-balanced 
;; 2. total-weight & branch-weight
;; I think these cases should be a seperated functions(procedures),
;; not a multiple function. Because branches also can have a mobile 
;; likewise mobile have branches. That is, it is not a one directional 
;; hierarchical structure.

;; About Lengths and Weights
;; * Only weights have weight, not lengths of branches.
;; Therefore to find a torque, all the weight values are equal to that
;; of the last branch
